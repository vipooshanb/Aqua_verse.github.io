                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p><b>HTML Techniques:-</b></p>
                        <p>The HTML structure for the Feedback Form is built with semantic HTML5 elements to ensure both usability and accessibility. The form is divided using <b>fieldset</b> and <b>legend</b> tags to group related inputs logically, improving screen reader navigation. Labels are properly linked to form inputs using the for attribute, and input types like email, tel, datetime-local, and file enhance the user experience and validation. The form submits data to the Web3Forms API using a hidden access_key, eliminating the need for server-side scripting. Visual icons from Boxicons and Font Awesome are used alongside labels to improve form clarity and aesthetics. A <b>video</b> element with autoplay, loop, and muted attributes adds a full-screen background that enhances the visual design without interfering with functionality. </p>
                        <p><b>CSS Techniques:-</b></p>
                        <p>The CSS code styles the feedback form using a clean, modern aesthetic and responsive layout techniques. A fixed-position background video with reduced opacity creates a subtle visual effect, while the .feedback-container is styled with a soft white background, rounded corners, shadows, and padding to make content stand out. Flexbox is used to layout input groups responsively, and media queries ensure that the form adapts gracefully to smaller screen sizes. Smooth transitions, hover effects, and color gradients are applied to buttons for dynamic interaction. Interactive form controls like radio groups, emoji ratings, and checkboxes are styled with rounded containers, spacing, and hover feedback. Custom focus styles and consistent spacing improve usability, and input fields include transition effects for a refined feel.</p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p> White or dark-colored text over soft backgrounds improves content readability across all devices. All form fields use proper <b>label</b> elements and placeholders for guidance. Inputs are constrained using maxlength, required, and title attributes for better form validation and keyboard navigation. The background video is kept visually passive with reduced brightness and should be marked with <b>aria-hidden="true"</b> to prevent screen reader interference. Visual elements such as emojis and icons are supplemented with text or can be enhanced using aria-label for screen reader compatibility. The layout is responsive and retains readability on mobile devices, ensuring an accessible and inclusive user experience.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p><b>HTML Techniques:-</b></p>
                        <p>The HTML structure for the Feedback Form is built with semantic HTML5 elements to ensure both usability and accessibility. The form is divided using <b>fieldset</b> and <b>legend</b> tags to group related inputs logically, improving screen reader navigation. Labels are properly linked to form inputs using the for attribute, and input types like email, tel, datetime-local, and file enhance the user experience and validation. The form submits data to the Web3Forms API using a hidden access_key, eliminating the need for server-side scripting.

A <b>video</b> element with autoplay, loop, and muted attributes adds a full-screen background that enhances the visual design without interfering with functionality. </p>
                        <p><b>CSS Techniques:-</b></p>
                        <p>The CSS employs a modern, responsive design using Flexbox and CSS Grid. A layered radial gradient background gives a professional, abstract feel. Cards are styled with transparency, blur effects, and subtle animations that activate on hover or focus. The <b>.team-card</b> elements expand with smooth transitions and contain distinct sections like <b>.card-image, .member-details, .member-tasks, and .social-links</b>. Visual enhancements such as text shadows, glowing borders, and color gradients are used throughout for a polished UI. Responsive breakpoints adapt layouts from 4-column grids down to single-column stacks for mobile devices, ensuring readability and usability on all screens.</p>
                        <p><b>JavaScript Techniques:-</b></p>
                        <P>A lightweight JavaScript script adds interactivity to team member cards by toggling the aria-expanded attribute based on keyboard, focus, and mouse events. This enables an accessible, dynamic expansion of card content when interacted with. Keyboard support includes Enter and Space keys to toggle details, enhancing both UX and accessibility.</P>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The team section implements best practices in accessibility. Each team card is focusable via keyboard with tabindex="0" and supports screen readers through ARIA attributes like aria-expanded. Visual elements are backed with meaningful alt texts for images, and color contrasts are carefully chosen for legibility. Interactive elements like social links use aria-labels for descriptive navigation. Focus states, hover effects, and scalable layout ensure a consistent experience across assistive technologies and screen sizes. The layout remains accessible on mobile, with no loss of content or functionality.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <P><b>HTML Techniques:- </b></P>
                        <p>The HTML structure is designed using semantic HTML5 elements such as <b>header, main, section, nav, and footer</b>to provide meaningful page structure, which enhances accessibility and SEO. A hero section with background image and animated particles visually engages users immediately. The main layout is built using a two-column structure with a sticky left sub-navigation <b>(nav)</b>, allowing quick jumps to various sections like ecosystems, biodiversity, and gallery.Each section uses descriptive headings <b>(h2, h3)</b> for better document hierarchy and screen reader navigation. Cards for ecosystems and species use consistent HTML structures including semantic grouping of content with image overlays and descriptive headings. Galleries and stats are built using grid-based responsive containers with clear and concise visual hierarchy.Interactive elements such as "scroll down" indicators, call-to-action buttons, and "go to top" buttons are implemented with accessible HTML elements like <b>button</b> or <b>a href</b>, ensuring keyboard operability and logical tab order. Icon usage is paired with textual descriptions to ensure clarity for all users.</p> 
                        <p><b>CSS Techniques:-</b></p>
                        <p>The CSS utilizes CSS variables for a consistent design system, making theming and color management simple across sections. The site’s layout employs Flexbox and CSS Grid extensively to create a fluid and responsive design that adapts from large screens to mobile devices.The hero section uses a full-screen background image with a linear gradient overlay and particle animation to create visual depth. Smooth keyframe animations like fadeInUp, pulse, float, and bounce enhance interactivity without relying on JavaScript.The left sub-navigation is styled with a sticky position, blur filters, and hover states to provide a modern and intuitive navigation experience. Cards in the ecosystems and biodiversity sections are styled with shadows, gradient borders, and hover zoom effects for an engaging UI.The enhanced gallery uses an animated image overlay with title and location descriptions, styled using <b>aspect-ratio, box-shadow,</b> and <b>transition</b> properties. Interactive elements such as buttons and icons incorporate smooth <b>:hover</b> and <b>:focus</b> transitions for tactile responsiveness.Responsive media queries ensure that layouts adjust cleanly across breakpoints (992px, 768px, 576px), collapsing columns into single-column formats and simplifying navigation on mobile devices.</p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The OceanLife website is designed with accessibility as a priority to ensure a seamless experience for all users, including those using assistive technologies. Semantic HTML elements such as <b>nav, section,</b> and <b>main</b> define clear content structure, enabling screen readers to interpret the page effectively. All interactive elements, including buttons, links, and navigation, are keyboard accessible with visible focus indicators for improved usability. Text content maintains high contrast against soft backgrounds, enhancing readability across devices. Labels, headings, and alternative text for images support screen reader navigation, while visual enhancements like particle animations and background images are intentionally subtle to avoid visual discomfort. Animations are smooth and non-intrusive, and ARIA attributes can be added to further enhance clarity for users relying on assistive tools. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring that content remains accessible and easy to read on screens of all sizes.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>One of the main challenges during the Life Below Water project was balancing rich visuals with performance and accessibility. Implementing animations, responsive layouts, and interactive cards required careful CSS structuring and testing across devices. We also encountered difficulties with image sizes affecting load speed. To resolve this, we optimized images using formats like WebP and ensured layouts were mobile-friendly using flexbox and media queries. The key lesson was to prioritize responsiveness and optimization from the beginning, ensuring a smooth and accessible user experience.</p>
